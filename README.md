# Roblox Fps Booster

This project was built to help low-end machines run the popular game, Roblox at a higher frame rate. This project was built
using C++ (A popular Object Oriented Programming Language). Every line of code in this project is used for the following: 

* Optimizes CPU for a faster Multi Threaded experience
* Optimizes RAM speed for more efficiency
* Temporarily pauses unneccesary programs in the background (Adjustable)

There are a few required resources that need to be satisfied before using the Roblox Fps Booster. Here All The Following Steps
On How To Install Them:

1. Install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank">Visual Studio C++ Redistributable</a>
As its is neccesary to properly run the application.

2. Open/Execute the Roblox Fps Booster.exe file

## Common Problems You May Have

There may be some reoccuring issues, as this project is still in Beta. Here are some common problems debugged during past Testing:

### Nothing Happening
A common problem that was discovered quite early in to the program is the Nothing Happening problem, as we call it. As the program is running in the background
it seems as if it is doing nothing. Some Common Fixes Include:

1. Checking if you have the latest version of the Visual Studio C++ Redistributable
2. Making sure your machine is up to date.
3. Try reinstalling and following the step by step instructions again.

### A New .txt File Being Created
This was a commonly asked question as our testers were testing this application, however the new .txt file that you see appearing in the same directory as the 
executable file is completely normal. This .txt stores the logs of the Roblox Fps Booster and is neccesary to debug any crashes that may occur in the future.
